# üöÄ Real-Time Airline Passenger Review Analysis

> Real-Time Sentiment & Satisfaction Classification for Airlines using Fluvio, FastAPI, Hugging Face, and Socket.IO

## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 3 ‚Äì Real-Time Data Experiences with Fluvio,
Stream, process, and act on real-time data using Fluvio**

---

## üéØ Objective

This project addresses the challenge of analyzing passenger feedback in real time. Airlines receive massive volumes of textual reviews that are often delayed in their analysis. This lag can prevent immediate insights into customer dissatisfaction and operational bottlenecks.

Our solution helps airlines process, analyze, and visualize customer sentiment in real-time‚Äîtransforming raw feedback into actionable insights, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and service quality.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Fluvio CLI installed
- Node.js (for frontend if dynamic)
- API key from Hugging Face (optional if local model)

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-team/airline-review-analyzer

# Backend Setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start FastAPI + Socket.IO
uvicorn app:app --reload

# Start Fluvio producer (in another terminal)
fluvio topic create social-tweets
python producer.py  # (to simulate tweets)

# Frontend Setup
cd ../frontend
# Open index.html in browser or use Live Server extension
